# Removed the deprecated 'python_paths = .' option.
# The search path fix is now handled reliably by tests/conftest.py.

# Crucial fix: Set the asyncio mode to 'auto'. This tells the pytest-asyncio 
# plugin to automatically handle all 'async def' tests and fixtures, which 
# resolves the PytestRemovedIn9Warning errors.

# Set the pattern for test file discovery
